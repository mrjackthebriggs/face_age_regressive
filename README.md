# Face Age
An application made in a group project as a submission for the university unit: Inteligent Systems. This was a group project, where one person each had to make a intelegent system and compare the two.
Both CNNs were fairly similar (being based off of a workshop example), but mine was regressive (meaning it output a float) vs the partner application, which classified photos into ages instead.

This program has serveral requirements:
- matplotlib==3.8.0
- numpy==1.26.0
- tensorflow==2.14.0
- Pillow==10.0.1 
- opencv-python==4.8.1.78
- scipy==1.11.3
- dlib==19.24.0
- shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat (in the main dir)

The photo libraries have been severely reduced to save room. There are some photos still there as an example to show formatting and process
